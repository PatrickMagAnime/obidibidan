Hi Riley, my name is Stefanius Pomparius and i recently came across your blog-post about farmers that get paid by people to help them. Your blog was very interesting and I can agree your assumption.
**(ppl learn how milk is produced, keep sth clean, handle living beings,)**
The first thing I want to mention is that working on a farm has a lot of benefits. People can learn how to handle other living beings and overall how farmers produce their products. For example milking a cow could be very interesting to experience.

**(it helps bc: it's cheap, fresh, free harvest, good for envi. bc lesser transport)**
Additionally, to help at a farm has benefits for both sides. You can help the farmer a lot with your work there, plus you will gain experience too. 

**(the economic benefits: fewer food waste, less work bc ppl help,)**

**(end yapp)**
