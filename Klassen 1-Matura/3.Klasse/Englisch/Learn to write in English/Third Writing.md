Hello Morgan, my name is Stefanius and I recently came across your blog-post about animals at educational institutions. I'm writing this comment in regard to ensure you that pets are not that dangerous tho and can have some benefits too.

Firstly, I'll say that pets might be an innovative education and experience for young adolescences. Moreover they can learn how to handle other live beings. I also do not think that they would get sick from germs.

You could also keep in mind that young children might be scared of some sorts of pets. The next important thing to check is if a child has some allergies to animals.

The last significant point I want to address is that you should respect the animals comfort zone. Don't over stress the pet.

Thank you for your post. Good luck adapting to a pet at your institution. I'm looking forward to your next posts!
